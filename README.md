# Crockford Keyboard

## Summary

The Crockford keyboard is a keyboard design Douglas Crockford made in 1981. Strangely, I never found a Javascript implementation for this keyboard, even though Crockford is among the most famous Javascript gurus around. Thus, I decided to implement a simple proof-of-concept myself.

This implementation is MIT licensed.
